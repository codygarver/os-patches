This testcase works for Ubuntu, Xubuntu and Lubuntu. and should work for all other flavours of *buntu

Depends:

    sudo apt-get install python-autopilot libautopilot-gtk python-xlib

python-xlib is needed for the x11 backend to work. universe repo needs activating in sources

But until support for setup and tear down has been implemented
the test needs modifying for Xubuntu and Lubuntu

To make these edits go into test_default.py and in the test_default_install method change

    self.keyboard.press_and_release('Super+1')

    To

    #self.keyboard.press_and_release('Super+1')

Once installed copy ubiquity & ubiquity-wrapper files to the right place

  sudo cp ubiquity/bin/ubiquity-wrapper /usr/bin/ubiquity
  sudo cp ubiquity/bin/ubiquity /usr/lib/ubiquity/bin/ubiquity

In one terminal
* Execute ./run_ubiquity to start ubiquity in "autopilot" mode

Wait for ubiquity to start up then in another terminal window
* Use ./autopilot as if it's `autopilot`, e.g.:
  ./autopilot list ubiquity
  ./autopilot run ubiquity

* for default install run
 	./autopilot run ubiquity

* for lvm install without encryption run
	./autopilot run ubiquity_lvm

* for lvm install with encryption run
	./autopilot run ubiquity_lvm_encrypt

* for 'something else' install run
	./autopilot run ubiquity_custom

NOTE: If running on Xubuntu or Lubuntu make sure that your terminal windows are not covering
the ubiquity continue button before you run ./autopilot run ubiquity.
